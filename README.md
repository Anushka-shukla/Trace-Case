# Trace-Case
With the increasing number of coronavirus cases day by day it's becoming hard to keep the track of records. So this application is built with a motive to serve the same purpose. It's a JAVA application built on the Spring Boot framework that lists the <b>total number of cases for the current day</b>, <b>cases reported since the previous day</b> globally.
